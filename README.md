# Low Earth Orbit Tracking Project
This project models and manages space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) through an interactive, menu-driven Java system. It enables scientists, space agencies, and policymakers to track debris, assess whether objects remain in orbit, and analyze potential impacts on space operations. The system supports multiple user roles (Scientist, Administrator, Policymaker, and Space Agency Representative) with tailored functionality such as density report generation, long-term impact analysis, and user account management.

The program integrates advanced object-oriented design (inheritance, abstraction, composition, and interfaces), UML modeling (use case, class, and state diagrams), and automated JUnit testing. To ensure security, the system implements password hashing and salting for user authentication. Robust exception handling, CSV input/output processing, and refactored design patterns were applied to produce a reliable and extensible software solution.
